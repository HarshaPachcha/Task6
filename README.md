## üßæ SQL Analysis

### 1. Monthly Revenue and Order Volume

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(price * quantity) AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(order_date, product_id)) AS order_volume
FROM 
    synthetic_online_retail_data
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date),
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY 
    year, month;
```
### 2. Top 3 Months by Revenue

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(price * quantity) AS monthly_revenue
FROM 
    synthetic_online_retail_data
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date),
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY 
    monthly_revenue DESC
